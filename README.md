# Anagraphs An Anagram Game With A Twist
 
Anagraphs, the new word game by the creator of Synonymy, is an anagram finding game with a twist: It uses a special font where several letters are vertically symmetrical. The game is published by educational non-profit <a href="https://www.cinqmarsmedia.com">Cinq-Mars Media</a> and is available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1537359369">iOS</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1537359369">Android</a> free.

# Getting Started
Download the codebase, cd into the directory and run "npm install". Then "ionic serve" should launch the project on localhost. 

An spreadsheet database of anagraphs used to make the game is included along with the font, identical to Roboto except for the symmetrical characters a/e, b/q, d/p, w/m, r/j, n/u and y/h. 

Please reach out with any questions, I will update the documentation soon!

Thanks
